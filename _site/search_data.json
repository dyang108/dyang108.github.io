      "content": " <p> Good web developers separate the three main parts of their page: HTML (Content), CSS (Stying), and JavaScript (Effects/server/whatnot). This page doesn’t do that. </p> \n\n <p> Okay. To be honest, I’m being lazy. Let me make a quick note of them, so that my web programming professor does not judge me for this. </p> \n\n <p> First off, trying to generate a search page for Jekyll requires some dynamic generation of content, and so I have JavaScript render it. There are extra templating tools, like  <a href=\"underscorejs.org\"> Underscore.js </a> , that will render content on a template so that even the search page can be purely HTML. (I’ll probably wanna do this later). </p> \n\n <p> Secondly, I have not found a way in Jekyll templates to render a background image easily in pure CSS. So, in a sort of hacky way, I defined the background image in the HTML template, so that it is clean for me to change the background whenever I want. </p> \n\n <p> Thanks to  <a href=\"https://github.com/maxjacobson\"> MJ </a> , who’s website is  <a href=\"http://www.hardscrabble.net/\"> here </a>  for the help on this. </p> \n"

      "content": " <p> I’ve told myself sometimes that I’m going to start a blog. I’ve tried to build one in a few random places, and it’s interesting because I didn’t really try to keep up with it after the first post. Maybe I post again three months later, but maybe not. </p> \n\n <p> This problem tends to compound upon itself, as when I start a new blog, I want the time between my posts to be rather consistent, and since I know that I will probably end up posting less and less frequently, I decide at the very beginning to try to space out my posts. This results in me just forgetting about it altogether, and never posting at all. </p> \n\n <p> So I’m gonna forget about the whole consistent time intervals between posts thing. Sure, perhaps I lose some consistency later on, but then again, perhaps not. Also, the fact is that I built this page on my own, so I feel like I am more likely to build on it. </p> \n\n <p> Great. Awesome. Now that that’s out of the way, I can post whenever I want. </p> \n"

This breakthrough is reminiscent of IBM’s Deep Blue in the 1990’s, beating chess champion Gary Kasparov in a test of man vs computer. </p> \n\n <p> Go is significantly harder for a computer to solve than chess, with approximately 10 <sup> 170 </sup>  board configurations. </p> \n\n <p> The program utilizes deep neural networks to determine the best possible move from a given position. After learning from millions of expert games, the program played against itself, learning to improve along the way. </p> \n\n <p> This is pretty big for Google (who designed the program), machine learning, and technology in general.

      "content": " <p> Ahh… the first day of classes. For the student, this means syllabi by the handful. (I will admit, however, that this post is also an attempt to get more material on to the page.)\nThis semester, I’m taking Machine Structure/Assembly Language, Web Programming, Real Analysis II and Statistics. </p> \n\n <p> In Comp 40 syllabus day, we were promised a dive deep down to the metal of the computer, learning the very basics of how computers work. Great stuff. From my experience working with C++, Java, and scripting languages, I have not had much chance to figure out how computers work. This semester, I think, is the time for that. I want to be able to learn: how computers work on their own, and how computers work talking to each other. There’s a lot of stuff left to learn, and I’m really excited to start to really  <em> understand </em>  computers. </p> \n\n <p> I’m sure, as I go on learning C in this class, I will come up with my typical coder’s list of complaints about the ‘basicness’ of the language, but as of now, I think it’s really helping me understand some more of the basic stuff that I need to know. I’ve been working from such a high level, that I think it’ll be pretty good for me to dig deeper. </p> \n\n <p> Here’s to more content, and much more additions to the site as I go on. (In the meantime, check out the cool Spotify widget I added on the  <a href=\"/links/\"> Links </a>  page). </p> \n\n <p> A cool thing about Jekyll for blogging is that I can edit this content way past the actual post date… so to be honest, if you’re reading this in 2020, chances are I probably changed this post to be more geared towards my 2020 audience. I can also (unlike in other types of blogs) sneakily insert posts at random dates way past the date I say. So I suppose that makes it hard for the user to trust that the posts that I write are actually posted on the date that I say they are. From now on, I say you can trust me when I say I put the correct date ( <strong> but you really can’t </strong> ). (see what i did there?). </p> \n"

I’m expecting to post about code, about travel, about stuff going on in the world, and on things that I find cool. We’ll see what happens.

At the press of a button, you can send an SMS to your roommate, suggesting that he/she take a night out, giving TripAdvisor suggestions for things to do based on their location. </p> \n\n <p> Status: Though we managed to put together all the individual pieces for the project, we still have work left to do integrating the pieces together.
