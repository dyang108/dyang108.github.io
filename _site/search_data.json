I hope to add stuff regularly, and I hope that the other sections of the site will soon be populated with more and more content. I’ll try to keep it updated regularly, depending on how busy life is going. In the meantime, you can check out my other sites  <a href=\"/links\"> here </a> . </p> \n\n <p> For this site, I utilized Jekyll, a templating tool that helps to build websites. </p> \n\n <p> I’m not quite sure what this site will turn into. I’m expecting to post about code, about travel, about stuff going on in the world, and on things that I find cool. We’ll see what happens. I’m pretty excited about the layout as of now. </p> \n"
