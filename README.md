# Derick Yang Jekyll site

## Check out my site [here](http://dyang108.github.io)

## Getting started

#### This is for actually running it (probably only for me)

Ensure that ruby, rubygems, and bundler are installed.

```
bundle install
```

Make sure you are using the latest version of the github-pages gem, because that's what they're using on the live version.

To start the app locally:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```
Then visit: <http://localhost:4000/>.
