# Derick Yang Jekyll site

## Check out my site [here](dyang108.github.io)

## Getting started

#### This is for actually running it (probably only for me)

Ensure that ruby, rubygems, and bundler are installed.

```
bundle install
```

To start the app locally:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```
Then visit: <http://localhost:4000/>.
