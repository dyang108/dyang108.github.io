I've been to China an uncountable number of times in my life (not in the mathematical sense; I'm pretty sure I've been to China a finite number of times). So you would expect me to know the lay of the land: how to act, where to go, what to eat.

Nah.

Last Friday, I got off a plane at Beijing Capital International Airport, excited as ever to see the new changes the Beijing unfailingly brings every two years. About two hours later, a thief in a food court stole my backpack, containing my passport, MacBook, and Kindle. So much for constant vigilance.

It's a thrilling story, and I'd be happy to share it with you some other time, but I think the parts that are more interesting relate to how I found my way out of China without a passport.
