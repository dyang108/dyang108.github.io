I'm a sophomore looking for internships, which means that I am currently concerned about interviews and career fairs and making an impression. Interestingly enough, I am writing this post between classes while sitting in a suit from Tufts' career fair today. (By the way, if you would like to hire me, my [resume](/resume/resume.html) is now online, thanks to some work i did for COMP 20). It'd be awesome if you want to hire me for this summer.
