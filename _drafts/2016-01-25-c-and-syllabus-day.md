Ahh... the first day of classes. For the student, this means syllabi by the handful. (I will admit, however, that this post is also an attempt to get more material on to the page.)
This semester, I'm taking Machine Structure/Assembly Language, Web Programming, Real Analysis II and Statistics.

In Comp 40 syllabus day, we were promised a dive deep down to the metal of the computer, learning the very basics of how computers work. Great stuff. From my experience working with C++, Java, and scripting languages, I have not had much chance to figure out how computers work. This semester, I think, is the time for that. I want to be able to learn: how computers work on their own, and how computers work talking to each other. There's a lot of stuff left to learn, and I'm really excited to start to really *understand* computers.

I'm sure, as I go on learning C in this class, I will come up with my typical coder's list of complaints about the 'basicness' of the language, but as of now, I think it's really helping me understand some more of the basic stuff that I need to know. I've been working from such a high level, that I think it'll be pretty good for me to dig deeper.

Here's to more content, and much more additions to the site as I go on. (In the meantime, check out the cool Spotify widget I added on the [Links](/links/) page). (February 2 update: I removed it and put it [here](/blog/2016/02/spotify-music)).

A cool thing about Jekyll for blogging is that I can edit this content way past the actual post date... so to be honest, if you're reading this in 2020, chances are I probably changed this post to be more geared towards my 2020 audience. I can also (unlike in other types of blogs) sneakily insert posts at random dates way past the date I say. So I suppose that makes it hard for the user to trust that the posts that I write are actually posted on the date that I say they are. From now on, I say you can trust me when I say I put the correct date (**but you really can't**). (see what i did there?).
