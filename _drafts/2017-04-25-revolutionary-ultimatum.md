Patrick Henry during the American Revolution: "Give me liberty, or give me death!"

I'm going to argue that this ultimatum in China today does not carry nearly the same weight as it did when Patrick Henry said it. Basically, a 1989-like democracy movement in China is unlikely to succeed, at least in the near future. Several reasons, I think: cultural feelings about death, fatigue from continual 'revolution', and the indifference of the CCP.

1. Cultural feelings about death. In the United States, dying for liberty is a true sacrifice: life is sacred, and should not be easily given for an unjust cause. We rarely hear of revolutionary martyrs, people who died for what they believe in. On the other hand, nearly every page of my Chinese history textbook mentions suicide, whether it be by a leader, a dissident, or a whole demographic. All these people are dying for what they believe in. The gesture loses its meaning when it's been done so many times in the past.
2. Fatigue from continual revolution. It's one of the common themes of Chinese history, noted by so many historians that it almost does not bear repeating. China and Chinese people are inclined to revolutionize, to change the whole system in a day, to overturn the current leadership to create a better, new China. But time and time again, they need to be reminded that Rome (and Beijing) weren't built in a day. A generation after the Cultural Revolution, radicalism is too fresh a reminder of the horrors of those ten years. Many Chinese are willing to pay the price for normalcy, and avoid drastic political movements.
3. Indifference of the CCP. If you say you're going to die for democracy, well then prove it. Mao once said "China has too many people, if someone is going to commit suicide, then let them do it". The Communist Party is actually better off if there are martyrs; it means that the most radical dissidents remove themselves from society. The amount that the CCP cares about the life of a martyr for democracy is small.

Liu Xiaobo, 2010 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, is currently a political prisoner of the CCP. He argued in his [essay](http://www.tsquare.tv/links/LiuXiaobo.html) "That holy word: Revolution" that "The least costly way to democratization and modernization is self-reform of the Communist Party". I believe him.
