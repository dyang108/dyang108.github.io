Hello!

I've recently joined Embark, a software company based in New York that develops college applications for universities and scholarship programs all over the world.

Our team has recently started a new project: an admissions platform utilizing the MEAN stack.

This means I've been developing on a whole lot of JavaScript-based frameworks recently. I've been building a lot on the knowledge I've gained through class. Since my previous posts, I have learned to accept JavaScript as a language that I'm going to have to deal with for probably my entire career as a developer. Hooray.

I think one of the best things to learn from working at a company is the structure of a professional project. I've built a number of projects on my own that probably do not follow best practices and may be somewhat incoherent to an onlooking developer. For the most part, this has been okay, since these projects have been pretty small in comparison to real-world projects like the one I'm working on at Embark. But if I ever want to build something more legitimate than a small, single-purpose, single-page application, I'll need a bit more knowledge about how the whole thing works.

I think I'm getting a bit of that... there's more to development than coding. There's a whole bunch of buzzwords that a new developer needs to get acquainted with pretty quickly. Continuous integration, end to end testing, unit testing, Circle, Travis, gulp, browserify, webpack, Mongo, Angular, React, Node, Flask, Django, git, npm, babel, jekyll, jade, markdown, Protractor, Selenium, webdriver, express, nodemon, standard, eslint, momentjs, bluebird, lodash, StormPath, bootstrap, uirouter, Jasmine, mocha, chai, s3, D3, Sass, LESS, REST, restangular, underscore...

The list could quite possibly go on forever.

I think I might build a section of this site called "What is...", explaining all of these buzzwords in detail so that anyone could understand them. Stay posted.
