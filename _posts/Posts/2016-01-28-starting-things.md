I've told myself sometimes that I'm going to start a blog. I've tried to build one in a few random places, and it's interesting because I didn't really try to keep up with it after the first post. Maybe I post again three months later, but maybe not.

This problem tends to compound upon itself, as when I start a new blog, I want the time between my posts to be rather consistent, and since I know that I will probably end up posting less and less frequently, I decide at the very beginning to try to space out my posts. This results in me just forgetting about it altogether, and never posting at all.

So I'm gonna forget about the whole consistent time intervals between posts thing. Sure, perhaps I lose some consistency later on, but then again, perhaps not. Also, the fact is that I built this page on my own, so I feel like I am more likely to build on it.

Great. Awesome. Now that that's out of the way, I can post whenever I want.
