Spotify has this cool widget thing that you can easily embed into your own pages. I'm gonna start to put them in my posts when I feel like it. The following is a playlist that my [roommate](http://rusty122.github.io/) and I put together. We call it the chill playlist.

<div class="profile-link">
<iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1266550198%3Aplaylist%3A3kGVQV5UelXQL3sq4Kf2ez&view=coverart" class="spotify-play" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
</div>
