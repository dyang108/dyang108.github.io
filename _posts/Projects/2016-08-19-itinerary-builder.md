At Polyhack this year at Tufts, I worked on a team to build a [web app](http://whooop.herokuapp.com/) for event-based trip planning. The idea is, when travelling/exploring/going out, you want to participate in events in the area, and plan trips around those events. We utilized the TripAdvisor and TicketLeap API's for the project, as well as the Google Maps API. We also used frameworks including Node, Bootstrap, and Express for the app.
