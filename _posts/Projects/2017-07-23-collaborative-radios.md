I'm writing a React Native app to create collaborative radios, so that people can listen to music in real time together, while not in the same room. Useful if you want to bond with some friends during work, while working in different places.

I'm using the Spotify API, WebSockets, Redux, Facebook SDK, Node-Cron, Node, Mongo, and Express.

For this project, I'm focusing a lot on structuring it rather professionally - it's more slow going, but definitely good in the long run. You can check out the project [here](https://github.com/dyang108/spotqueue).
