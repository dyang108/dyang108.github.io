For COMP 40 (Machine Structure and Assembly Language), I built a universal machine abstraction on top of the existing machine that parses and executes fourteen unique instructions. After working with x86 assembly language, the natural next step was to create a machine for our own 14-instruction assembly language, complete with 8 32-bit 'registers' and segmented memory allocation. The program takes a program file (with the extension '.um'), parses the instructions, and executes them in a cycle. 

My [partner](https://github.com/isaacwr) and I completed this assignment in the hopes of improving the performance of the machine later. 

Current status: Complete, now working on the assignment profiling our UM, looking for places where we can improve the speed.
