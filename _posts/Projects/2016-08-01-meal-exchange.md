I started working on a project so that students at the end of each semester could exchange the leftover meals on their plans for money. I'm using a MEAN stack to build the marketplace. This is a very similar structure to the project I worked on at Embark this summer.

The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dyang108/swipe2)
