I really like Sublime Text. These days, I get annoyed at Microsoft Word because I cant use Cmd-Ctrl-up to move a line up or down.

Anyhow, I wrote about ten lines of shell script because I wanted to use Sublime to edit my LaTeX, and I couldn't find anything suitable that wasn't super verbose. It's been proven to work, because I did all my math and computer science assignments using this last semester. Takes a little configuration, but [here it is.](https://github.com/dyang108/lxrender)
