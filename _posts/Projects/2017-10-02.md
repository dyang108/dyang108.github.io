My sister wanted a professional website (and Google wasn't fitting her needs). So I built her one, which can be found [here](https://github.com/dyang108/site-template). It's pretty customizable and pretty cool. If you want to use it, you can fork the repo and push it to Heroku, and customize on the pages as described on the README.
