A tool to see whats going on on campus.
At HackDartmouth in October 2015, I collaborated with other students to build a social-media web application to keep track of events on campus. The idea is to cluster users based on location and show where people are gathered on campus.

Status: Good front end. We utilized a Google Maps API and started playing around with it. I would really like to continue working on this a little more. Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/dyang108/partymap).
