I worked on a critical project at Strava called Rain. It's a key-value store for immutable batch Spark outputs. We can use it for all sorts of things, enabling immutable batch refresh on the fly, automatically, and deploy-free. I wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/strava-engineering/rain-a-key-value-store-for-stravas-scale-7f580f5b4848) about it. Check it out and give me claps!
