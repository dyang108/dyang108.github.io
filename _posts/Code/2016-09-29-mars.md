If you haven't heard already, Elon Musk came out yesterday and changed the universe. SpaceX has [come out with a plan](http://www.spacex.com/mars) to reach the Red Planet in the next 10 years. Knowing Elon Musk (not personally, but I'd like to know him), that'll probably mean something closer to 25-30 years.

Even with the more conservative schedule, the first missions to Mars could fall within my lifetime. I understand there are some skeptics out there that simply don't believe in Elon Musk's lofty promises, and there are others who have legitimate concerns about the actual science behind his plans (solar flare radiation, anyone?). But the thing is, only dreamers can change the history of the human race.

The way I think of it, this is pretty much exactly the same thing as travelling to the New World in the 15th/16th century. The skepticism, the legitimate possibility of death, the 3-6 month journey, the time frame, and the price are all pretty similar to what history tells us about the first explorers New World. And look how that turned out.

Let's go to Mars. The trip, according to Elon, will be "a lot of fun".
