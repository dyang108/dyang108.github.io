I've been indoctrinated into a certain mindset out here in Silicon Valley. 4 months in, and I'm spewing the ethos of my company to my family, my friends, and strangers. It's fantastic. (By the way, if you want inexpensive access to sophisticated financial advice, as well as access to a time-tested and proven investment strategy, check out [Wealthfront](wealthfront.com)).

I've joined at perhaps the most interesting and trying time of a company. We have some name recognition in the finance/tech world of predominantly coastal young professionals. We have around 150 employees, have seen a year's worth of solid growth, and need to build to scale for the next million clients.

What I've realized is that it's an incredible opportunity to work at a company of our size, specifically because of the experience that comes from scaling systems. Data engineering at Wealthfront has been working for the last year on scaling our data infrastructure to handle increased loads in trades, client signups, and user interactions with our financial planning tool. We get the sort of problems that giant companies don't get (anymore). The primary services at Facebook or Google won't have 10x their current user base, simply because there aren't that many people in the world. Certainly, there are subteams at these companies that will be building to scale. We're in a phase where large infrastructure projects will affect the whole company, which I find particularly exciting.

What we're doing now is scaling our data warehouse to take on 10x the data that it currently does. We're working on projects to take online computations offline into our data platform. We're working on improving computations to calculate projections into our client's futures.

There's a lot going on here, and I'm excited for it.
