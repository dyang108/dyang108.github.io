The biggest story out of Silicon Valley this year so far has been far and away the Uber IPO. One of the biggest privately held companies of all time, Uber has long [dominated the talk of "unicorns"](/economics/2019/05/16/the-unicorn-bubble) in the tech sphere. Since its founding around the advent of the iPhone, numerous new companies have popped up claiming to be "the Uber of [blank]".

Uber is taking part in a [wave of IPOs](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/a-quick-2019-tech-ipo-check-in/) this year, the participants of which include Lyft, Pinterest, Slack, Zoom, and PagerDuty. Rumors have been circulating about We Co. (WeWork), Palantir, and AirBnB going public this year, too.

So far, these IPOs haven't been doing great - Uber dropped 17% in two days, after pricing on the lower side of their range. Lyft has lost around a third of its value since IPO. Clearly public markets haven't been taking to the cash burning unicorns as much as private markets have.

One attractive feature of being a venture capitalist, or an employee at an early-stage startup, is that you have considerable upside to the equity you own in the company, especially in the event of an IPO. Unfortunately, for many longtime Uber employees, the equity that they owned in the company has [not appreciated in value](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-09/uber-ipo-employees-may-not-be-in-a-partying-mood) since they joined the company. IPOs this year have not done a good job of convincing the venture capitalist or early-stage startup employee (such as myself) that the value of their investment will increase significantly with the initial public offering. I'm concerned that the appeal of investing in private companies for venture capitalists will significantly decrease with the wave of IPOs this year. *Especially* if IPOs continue to go as poorly as they have.

Perhaps the public markets aren't fooled by the sparkle of buzzwords like "cloud", "AI", and "machine learning". One indicator of this is the fact that one of the most successful high-profile IPO this year was Beyond Meat, a company that makes (delicious) vegan meat through a combination of plant-based materials and chemicals. They're currently at 4x their IPO valuation, but they are *definitely* not tech.

Perhaps investors in the public markets don't have 100 billion dollars to burn (most don't). Public investors are gonna have a little more sensitivity to a billion dollars of cash burn every year. Like, it's pretty hard for a sales and trading intern to make a compelling pitch on a company that [may never make a profit](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-ipo/uber-unveils-ipo-with-warning-it-may-never-make-a-profit-idUSKCN1RN2SK). In the private markets (or as some may call it, the "magical forest"), there's a tendency to sell a "mission" or a "vision" rather than future cash flows. You could have a hotshot CEO that gives inspiring [albeit poorly delivered](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-you-can-learn-from-how-elon-musk-presents-2017-5) speeches. There's a way to manufacture non-GAAP metrics that make you look good (ie, [adjusted EBITDA](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-04-27/wework-accounts-for-consciousness)) and make you look like you're growing. Executives out here in the Bay Area have this magical ability to hook you on an idea. CEOs are particularly good at pitching to private investors, but when the shares go public, you don't get as much facetime with the execs. All private investors get to meet the CEO on a mission; public investors don't. That's one of the reasons why Lyft and Uber's S1 filings are so filled with stories about the company vision, mission and values. There's no financial value in that, but they've been selling the value to private investors for years, and it's worked. Once these companies are public, they don't get the benefit of the doubt. Subject to scrutiny and metrics galore, these companies don't generate discounted cash flow models to the public markets' liking.

[Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-14/there-was-no-way-to-win-with-the-uber-ipo) loves talking about how private markets are the new public markets, how companies like [Forge](https://forgeglobal.com/) are making pre-IPO shares more liquid, and how companies (in particular, big, high growth tech companies) are able to make most of the money they need in the private markets. This is very much thanks to huge venture capital funds, like Sequoia and Benchmark. Not to mention the questionable-at-best hand of the [Saudi sovereign wealth fund](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/venture-capitals-sovereign-wealth-crisis-cometh/) and [SoftBank's Vision Fund](https://group.softbank/en/).

The [Vision Fund](https://visionfund.com/) somehow managed to [allocate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-considers-ipo-for-100-billion-vision-fund-11556882710) the hundred billion dollars worth of capital in just over two years, out of the expected four. This is a testament to either (a) the strength and growth opportunities available in their tech-heavy portfolio, or (b) a gross overestimation of the value of the companies they are investing in. As an engineer in the Bay Area, I am crossing my fingers that it's the former. Their investors seem to think so too, and for good reason. The fund has already returned [45% net of fees](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/09/softbank-is-launching-a-second-version-of-its-100-billion-fund-driving-silicon-valley-valuations.html) to partners. The Vision fund is itself seeking to go public, which would provide some liquidity to its generally illiquid parts. After jumping through some legal and regulatory hoops, a public Vision Fund would look like Berkshire Hathaway, except with a growth-focused rather than a value-focused mindset. It'd provide proxy access to investment in private companies for the individual investor. 

The Vision Fund is supposedly going for a round 2 of over a hundred billion dollars in capital allocation, after tapping out the first hundred billion too quickly. This'll be a great driver for continued over-inflated startup valuations. This new Vision Fund is one (large) counterargument to the point that private investors could abandon their large-scale bets on startups in the future. 

Only time (and more IPOs) will tell whether IPOs have a negative impact on private market funding. For now, things don't seem to be slowing down. But given market volatility and trade uncertainty, I wouldn't be surprised if venture capitalists decided to invest with a little more traditional due diligence.
