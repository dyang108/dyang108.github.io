A tool for college roommates to communicate using the simplest UI in the world
During Tufts Polyhack in November 2015, I collaborated on a project utilizing several different API's to facilitate roommate communication.
We utilized the [bt.tn](https://bt.tn/) to create a simple way to communicate with your college roommate. At the press of a button, you can send an SMS to your roommate, suggesting that he/she take a night out, giving TripAdvisor suggestions for things to do based on their location. 

Status: Though we managed to put together all the individual pieces for the project, we still have work left to do integrating the pieces together. We did not host our website, and the bttn had a limited number of uses. I think the bttn is a very interesting tool, and I would like to explore more uses of it later.
